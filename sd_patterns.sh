#!/bin/bash
# bash script for searching patterns that could indicate problems and errors in the extracted Support Dump of a MKE cluster
# Developed by gdoumas@mirantis.com during 2021
# Prerequisites : A linux laptop with bash-5 installed, or a windows laptop with Windows Subsystem for Linux , wsl , that provides an Ubuntu inside windows
# TO DO : put more patterns, and maybe remove some if the information they give (matched lines) can be gathered by another pattern
# This script is called by sd_handle.sh(sd_handle.py) , so they must be in the same folder
